# Create an empty class named Cat.

class Cat

Defining a class is similiar to defining a method, except for two notable differences:

1. when defining a class, the reserved word class is used instead of def.
2. when naming a class, the CamelCase format is used instead of the snake_case format

classes, like methods, also use the reserved word end to finish the definiton.
